          Hi, I'm James. I work for a large P&C that helps protect and restore dreams. I've had the opportunity to work with
          many talented individuals. Both in-house and external teams across the nation. It's been amazing!
        </p>
        <p>I’m responsible for leading cross-disciplined teams through a user-centered design process. I lead and
          support designers in building highly functional and aesthetic experiences. I am also responsible for
          experience
          strategy, research, and process improvement. I "thinking creative" and keep solutions on brand, impactful,
          and deliverable.</p>
        
        <p>
          My most significant contribution has been leading the charge for creating design standards. Why is this
          important? Our products were inconsistent with the expectation of customers and partners. The root of our
          inconsistencies was the avoidance of love and evolution of our standards. So, we developed a road map to
          change
          the digital landscape. First, we altered our customer-facing brand site, www.amfam.com. Second, we
          consolidated
          our energy on our self-service portals. Third, create a system that creates a more efficient and cohesive
          product ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m a curious intrapreneur looking to solve problems through creative solutions. The military honed my
          leadership skills and real-world perspective. I enjoy working with others and empowering them to grow.
        </p>
